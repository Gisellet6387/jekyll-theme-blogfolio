What Is A Planetarium?
   
   Planetariums offer insight to astronomy and how space has evolved through centuries. It gives both children and adults the opportunity to give themselves an idea of how space is up close. 

It's a place you can go and sit and “watch the stars” and just the whole universe in front of your eyes. It's like a theatre for stars but not to represent the science behind it but the culture . 

History

Famous planetariums in the United States are the Hayden in NY, Alder in Chicago, and the Griffith in Los angeles which were all built in the 1930s

In 1935 a planetarium opened in New Yorkcalled the Hayden planetarium. It's still around today and getting renovated little by little. 

Although In London the idea came later on in 1958


My Experience


The first time I ever went to a planetarium I was facinated. I saw the stars and was just mezmerised with what I saw. It was a big room with the soft chairs. I was really small but remeber that day like if it was just yesterday. The room was cold and a guy started talking explaining more about what we were about to see, then it started. The lights went off and the evolution of space started hapening right infront of my eyes. I saw stars, milkyways, the moon and sun infront of my on the big screen on the ceiling. After that day I've been wanting to go back but never got too it. I know for sure that I will return and that it will be the best experience ever.
